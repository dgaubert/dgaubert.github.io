title: "About me"

I’m a software engineer and, I like it!. Indeed I didn’t know it when I began my studies on computer science at [CES Santa Bárbara](https://www.centrosantabarbara.es/). I didn’t type code before and rarely sat down in front of a computer. Why did I become a software developer?. I’d have liked to study architecture, for instance. However, architecture was a six years degree and, I didn’t have much time to finish my studies. Hence, two years of vocational degree fit better for me.

Once I got the foundations of programming I wanted to learn more, teachers encouraged me to carry on with my studies. I took the risk and got into [Carlos III University](https://www.uc3m.es/). Almost three years after, I had to start working full time, and I couldn’t complete my degree entirely.

I joined [Hecate Projects](https://www.linkedin.com/company/h-cate-proyectos-s-l-/) in July 2007. Hecate was a three people company focused on IT consultancy. There I got experience in Java and J2EE ecosystem. I always am grateful to Pilar Manero and Raúl Vega as they were my first family in a software company.

In November 2009 I got enough resources to complete my degree in computer science. In May 2010 I submitted my End of Career Project about Wireless Sensor Networks, later renamed as IoT (internet of things).

In July 2010, with my computer science degree in my back pocket, I joined [Paradigma Tecnológico](https://www.paradigmadigital.com/) to work on an advertising tracking system for Havas Digital. Luckily, we had room for researching new tools and databases as one of the main requirements that we had was performance. In this project, I programmed mostly in Java and Javascript. There I learned a lot from really skilled people like Javier Monterrubio and Antonio Alvarado; they were an inspiration for my professional career.

Sadly, the project concluded in July 2012. As I was in the outsourcing division of Paradigma Tecnológico, they relocated me to a different project. I was working in the IT department of Mutua Madrileña as a backend engineer. Their tech stack was based on Java frameworks, such as Spring, Structs, etc.. During the year and a half I was there I reconsidered my professional career. I didn’t find much recompense by working for third-party companies, so I tried to revert that situation by learning a new technology that allowed me to enter in a product based company.

As I had experience with Javascript and, Node.js was trendy for the time being, I chose Node.js as my first framework. When I felt ready to change, I joined [TAPTAP Networks](http://www.taptapnetworks.com/), a mobile advertisement company, in February 2014 as a Fullstack Engineer. I was fortunate to be a member of a talented team: Cesar Ortiz, Nicolás Nombela, Sergio Arroyo, Javier Álvarez, Andrés Iniesta and, Jose Honrado were some them. I learned a lot about how to build and scale high performant services.

In October 2015, I had the chance of joining [CARTO](https://carto.com/). My commitment is to build and maintain the main APIs that brings Location Intelligence to companies to make decisions that increase revenue and drive business performance. CARTO is a constant challenge place to work where I learn every day from the top-notch engineers and managers. Last year, I led the Engine Team, and today I help to build CARTO as Principal Node.js Engineer.
