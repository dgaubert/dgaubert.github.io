I'm a software engineer and, I like it!. Indeed I didn't know it when I began my studies on computer science at CES Santa Bárbara. I didn't type code before and rarely sat down in front of a computer. I preferred to play basketball and spend time out there. Why did I become a programmer?. I'd have liked to study architecture. However, architecture was a six years degree and, I didn't have much time to finish my studies. Hence, two years of professional training course fit better for me.

Once I had the basics of programming I wanted to learn more, teachers encouraged me to carry on with my studies. I took a risk and got into Carlos III University. Almost three years after, I had to start working full time and, I couldn't complete my degree entirely.

I joined Hecate Projects on July 2007. Hecate was three people company focused on IT consultancy. There I got a lot of experience in Java and J2EE ecosystem. I was working there for 2 years and, I always am grateful to Pilar and Raúl as they were my first family in a software company.

In November 2009 I got enough money to complete my degree in computer science. In May 2010 I submitted my End of Career Project about Wireless Sensor Networks, recently renamed as IoT (internet of things).

In July 2010, with my Computer Science degree in my back pocket, I joined Paradigma Tecnológico to work on an advertising tracking system for Havas Digital. Luckily, we had room for testing new tools and databases as one of the requirements that we had was performance. In this project, I programmed mostly in Java and Javascript. There I learned a lot from really skilled people like Javier Monterrubio and Antonio Alvarado, they were kind of inspiration for my professional career.
