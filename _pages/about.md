title: "About me"
---

I’m an enthusiastic software engineer. Even though I didn’t know it when I began my studies on computer science at [CES Santa Bárbara](https://www.centrosantabarbara.es/). I didn't type code before and rarely sat down in front of a computer. Why did I become a software developer?. I’d have liked to study architecture, for instance. However, architecture was a six years degree and, I didn’t have much time to finish my studies. Hence, two years of vocational degree fit better for me.

Once I got the basics of programming I wanted to learn more, teachers encouraged me to begin a Computer Science degree. I accepted the challenge and got into [Carlos III University](https://www.uc3m.es/). Almost three years after, I had to start working full time despite I didn't finish my degree.

I joined [Hecate Projects](https://www.linkedin.com/company/h-cate-proyectos-s-l-/) in July 2007. Hecate was a three people company focused on IT consultancy. There I got experience in Java and J2EE ecosystem. I'm extremely grateful to Pilar Manero and Raúl Vega as they were my first family in a software company.

In November 2009, I got enough resources to complete my degree. In May 2010 I presented my End of Career Project about Wireless Sensor Networks, later renamed as IoT (internet of things).

In July 2010, with my Computer Science degree in my back pocket, I joined [Paradigma Tecnológico](https://www.paradigmadigital.com/) to work on an advertising tracking system for Havas Digital. Luckily, we had a room for researching new tools and databases as one of the main requirements that we had was high performance. In this project, I programmed mostly in Java and Javascript. There I learned a lot from skilled engineers like Javier Monterrubio and Antonio Alvarado; they were an inspiration for my professional career.

Sadly, the project concluded in July 2012. As I was in the outsourcing division of Paradigma Tecnológico, they relocated me to a different project. I was working in the IT department of Mutua Madrileña as a backend engineer. Their tech stack was based on Java frameworks, such as Spring, Structs, etc.. During the year and a half I was there I reconsidered my professional career path. I didn’t find much recompense by working for third-party companies, so I tried to revert that situation by learning a new technology that allowed me to join a product based company.

As I had experience with Javascript and, Node.js was trendy for the time being, I chose Node.js as my primary framework. When I felt ready to change, I joined [TAPTAP Networks](https://www.taptapnetworks.com/), a mobile advertisement company, in February 2014 as a Fullstack Engineer. I was lucky to be a member of a talented team: Cesar Ortiz, Nicolás Nombela, Sergio Arroyo, Javier Álvarez, Víctor Iniesta, and Jose Honrado were some them. I learned a lot about how to build and scale high performant services.

In October 2015, I had the chance of joining [CARTO](https://carto.com/). My commitment is to build and maintain the main APIs that brings Location Intelligence to companies to make decisions that increase revenue and drive business performance. CARTO is a continuous challenge where I learn every day from the top-notch engineers and managers. Last year, I led the Engine Team, and today I help to build CARTO as Principal Node.js Engineer.
