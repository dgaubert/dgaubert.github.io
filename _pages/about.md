I'm a software engineer and, I like it!. Indeed I didn't know it when I began my studies on computer science at CES Santa Bárbara. I didn't type code before and rarely sat down in front of a computer. I preferred to play basketball and spend time out there. Why did I become a programmer?. I'd have liked to study architecture. However, architecture was a six years degree and, I didn't have much time to finish my studies. Hence, two years of professional training course fit better for me.

Once I had the basics of programming I wanted to learn more, teachers encouraged me to carry on with my studies. I took a risk and got into Carlos III University. Almost three years after, I had to start working full time and, I couldn't complete my degree entirely.

I joined Hecate Projects on July 2007. Hecate was three people company focused on IT consultancy. There I got a lot of experience in Java and J2EE ecosystem. I was working there for 2 years and, I always am grateful to Pilar Manero and Raúl Vega as they were my first family in a software company.

In November 2009 I got enough money to complete my degree in computer science. In May 2010 I submitted my End of Career Project about Wireless Sensor Networks, later renamed as IoT (internet of things).

In July 2010, with my Computer Science degree in my back pocket, I joined Paradigma Tecnológico to work on an advertising tracking system for Havas Digital. Luckily, we had room for researching new tools and databases as one of the requirements that we had was performance. In this project, I programmed mostly in Java and Javascript. There I learned a lot from really skilled people like Javier Monterrubio and Antonio Alvarado, they were kind of inspiration for my professional career.

Sadly, the project concluded in July 2012. As I was in the outsourcing division of Paradigma Tecnológico, they relocated to me into another project. I was working for the IT department of Mutua Madrileña as a backend engineer. Their tech stack was based on Java frameworks, such as Spring, Structs, etc.. During the year and a half I was there I reconsidered my professional career. I didn't find much recompense by working for third companies so I learned a new technology that allowed me to enter in a product based company.

As I had experience with Javascript and, Node.js was trendy for the time being, I chose Node.js as my main knife in my toolbox. When I felt ready to change, I joined TAPTAP Networks, a mobile advertisement company, in February 2014 as a Fullstack Engineer. I was fortunate to be a member of a really talented team: Cesar Ortiz, Nicolás Nombela, Sergio Arroyo, Javier Alvarez, Andrés Iniesta and, Jose Honrado were some them. I learned a lot about how to build and scale high performant services.

In October 2015, I had the chance of joining CARTO, one of the most successful startups in Spain as Node.js developer. My commitment is to build, maintain and, improve the main APIs that brings Location Intelligence to companies to make decisions that increase revenue and drive business performance. CARTO is a constant challenge place to work where I learn every day from the top-notch engineers and managers.
